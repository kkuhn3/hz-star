				On The Radar
				<div class="text">
					These options are strong, maybe problematically so.
				</div>
				<div class="h2">
					BN1's Anubis
					<div class="text">
						BN1 has low damage compared to the rest of the series. Anubis is one of few options that isn't reduced by armor. There are only a few chips that can remove Anubis, making it difficult to remove in a singleton format. 
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="h2">
					BN3's VarSwrd
					<div class="text">
						Effectively 800 damage, VarSwrd is one of the strongest chips in the series. It's more "execution" than "interactive". However, there is skill in the execution. If VarSwrd required no inputs, it'd be overwhealming. 
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="h2">
					BN4's Dark Soul
					<div class="text">
						Dark soul has two benifits: access to dark chips, and Dark Soul Unison - inviciblity and uncontrollable actions when they would be deleted. Dark soul has a couple of downsides as well: no access to "light" chips, and permanent max HP drops. Dark soul is both strong, and works against the "one save" convenience of the format. As once dark soul is obtained, the save is forever worse as a light soul save.
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="h2">
					BN6's BgDthThd
					<div class="text">
						BgDthThd turns MegaMan's buster into a thunder ball. This leads to players purposefully not using chips, favoring buster wars and slow gauge. We want the format to exhibit unique folder decisions, not use one chip and buster away.
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="h2">
					BN6's BugRSwrd
					<div class="text">
						BugRSwrd faces the same issues as BgDthThd, centralises folder building and replaces the need for chips. However, BugRSwrd is noticeably worse. BugRSwrd has range issues, and doesn't linger in the same style as BgDthThd.
